  <h1>About Me</h1>
<h5>A Computer Engineering Student</h5>
<p> So to talk about me, there’s nothing much to talk about, not that I’m low-key or being mysterious or something, I myself is already an extrovert and pretty much my actions says it all.</p>
<p>I do enjoy being alone once in a while after being socially drained, showing smiles here and there is tiring asf, and so I read books, listen to some music, write some poetries, quotes or even stories.</p>
<p>Don’t try know me better, my image changes depending on the person whom I’m dealing with, that’s just how it works and I kept it that way.</p>
<p>I’ve got no accomplishments in this life so called “reality”, but I guess I can find myself along the way this path of mine that I’m taking, by just simply existing.</p>
